# on-hand-eats

On Hand Eats is a personal project of mine that feeds off of my journey to learning how to cook healtheir and easy to make meals, no pun intended.
The main focus of this project is to key in the ingredients that you have in your house hold at that point in time and will generate a list of 
dishes to choose from and ultamitely create a library of your favorite dishes. This project will include the use of a backend server to hold 
said data into and exhibit the core concepts of React that I have learned thus far.
